## Description
This is creating a tech blog, which can properly display and create comments, users, and posts. This is very useful for people who want to communicate with others on a website which is free and has no real downside. It has password validation, and can do so much more. What is really special about this is that the connection between all of these can be implemented much more properly in the future with more and more developments. The major problems I had with this was understanding the folder structure with everthing being so complicated and layered.
